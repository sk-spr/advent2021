# skye's advent of code
This is my submission for advent of code (don't mind if i'm late somedays idk yet)

I've chosen to do this in JS, as I have been using it on a few projects lately

don't judge my code ok
## comments on the tasks so far
### day 1
#### task 1:
pretty easy, good introduction to the theme
#### task 2:
not very hard either, though the description was slightly misleading in my view

### day 2
#### task 1:
not as easy as day one but still pretty easy
#### task 2:
again, a bit harder but overall fine

### day 3
#### task 1:
pretty easy, not much to say
#### task 2:
see above

### day 4
#### task 1:
wow they had us do a bingo solver. I whipped up an algorithm but I'm sure it could be optimised
#### task 2:
literally needed one line of adjustment to add a lambda predicate

### day 5
#### task 1:
it's getting difficult, coded myself into a corner quite a bit
#### task 2:
had to do a near full rewrite to solve both...
