# skye's advent of code
This is my submission for advent of code (don't mind if i'm late somedays idk yet)

I've chosen to do this in JS, as I have been using it on a few projects lately

don't judge my code ok
## comments on the tasks so far
### day 1
#### task 1:
pretty easy, good introduction to the theme
#### task 2:
not very hard either, though the description was slightly misleading in my view

### day 2
#### task 1:
not as easy as day one but still pretty easy
#### task 2:
again, a bit harder but overall fine
